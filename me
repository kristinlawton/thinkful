Describe yourself in two to three sentences.
i am the story my brain tells me, in this moment, a fabric of memories and experiences woven of the past, stored in the energy and matter of the universe. a blink in time. i love life, am walking in the Himalayas, the Highlands of Peru, scouting wildflowers in Crested Butte, wandering on grassy hills, snowbarding bumps and powder at 13k feet, kayaking on the upper colorado, camping in aspen groves, watching butterflies land on flowers, marveling at the mandalas within, photographing the worlds in a water droplet, or ice crystals, eternity in a grain of sand (blake). I'm curious and effervescent. Love a hot bath, good music, and artful, natural food. I have trouble with authority and corporate culture. I'm a free spirit, inclined to wander.
