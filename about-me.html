	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I'm a principal information architect with 18 years of experience helping non-profits succeed online. I've led large website redesigns for many of the largest non-profit organizations in the US and Canada. 
  
<p>My goal is to create online experiences that inspire and delight users and tell the story of our clients' work with beautiful visuals. We've won 2 Interactive Media Awards ("Best in Class") for non-profit website design in 2014 for <a href=" http://www.feedingamerica.org">www.feedingamerica.org</a> and <a href="http:// www.commoncause.org">www.commoncause.org</a>.</p>

<p>Other recent designs include:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.childrenscoloradofoundation.org">Children's Hospital Colorado Foundation</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.couragetours.org">Courage Classic</a></li>
  <li><a href="www.courageis.org">Courage Is</a></li>
</ul>
  
<p>Our user experience-focused design methodology includes strategy and user research, stakeholder interviews, information architecture, wireframes, content strategy, CMS content modeling, technical specs, design, usability testing, development, QA, launch, training delivery and post-launch analysis.</p> 
<p>I started my career with the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund in 1996 as a developer of the Webby award-winning environmental information service scorecard.org.</p>  
<p>I was a founding member of GetActive Software in 2000, which grew from a start-up of 10 people to the 2nd largest eCRM provider to non-profit organizations in the US.</p>
